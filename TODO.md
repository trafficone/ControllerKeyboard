TODO List
=========

The following are planned items which need to be implemented for each milestone.
These should be included in the GitHub issue tracker ASAP.

General Release
---------------

* Modular module-ized code - controllerkeyboard.py should only be a wrapper
* Support adding new controller configurations
* Replace PyMouse + PyWin32 with Autopy https://github.com/msanders/autopy/
* Smoother, more intuitive mouse movement

First Round Improvements
------------------------

* Support for at least one more controller (Ouya? Maybe?)
* Support for at least one more platform (Ubuntu, most likely)
* Japanese IME Support - requires input rethink - holding left analog overrides mouse input from right
* 2-key combinations w/ support CTRL, ALT, ESC, and META

Second Round Improvements
-------------------------

* Support for user-configurable keyboard layouts.
* More intuitive, possibly prettier, on-screen display.

Pie-in-the-Sky Improvements
---------------------------

* Browser integration for context-sensitive typing.
* Word suggestion for faster typing.
* Support for more controllers (PS3, Steam, PS4, Steering Wheel, Oculus Rift?)
* Support for more platforms (Other Linux distros, MacOSX, OpenBSD?)
